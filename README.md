Data analysis work from school assessment

There was one assessment in this course:

Programming Tools for Urban Analytics Summative Assessment
Dr. Qunshan Zhao, Lecturer in Urban Analytics
1. Overview
The aim of this course is to familiarize students with programming tools which allow them to
access, collect, manage, analyze, visualize, and understand urban big data efficiently and
effectively. It will cover techniques required to extract data from on-line Application
Protocol Interfaces (APIs), set up a database for holding data in a way which enables
efficient analysis, and statistic/machine learning and visualization tools. It will cover best
practices in relation to coding (Python, SQL/NoSQL queries), collaborating on coding projects
(Unix Shell, Git, and GitHub), and reproducibility of analyses (Jupyter Lab/Notebook).
Students will undertake a data science project which requires them to demonstrate the skills
which they have acquired during the course. You will be required to submit a single Jupyter
Notebook and a HTML file generated from the Jupyter Notebook including all your Python
code and markdown-style written report, with a maximum of 3,000 words (not including
code and reference). You will need to submit your final assignment through Moodle.
The assignment is due in by noon on the 29th March 2021.
2. Content and Format
The final data science report should broadly follow the style of a quantitative journal article,
with the exception that you should focus on the data analysis and explanation of your data
analysis. It is not necessary to include a detailed literature review, though you may choose to
cite papers to support some of your choices e.g., your research question, your choice of
variable, the assumptions you make, and so on. The data science report should outline what
your research question is and what data you will use to address it. You will analyze your data
by using the tools and packages you have learnt in the classroom though using extra Python
packages to achieve your project goals is highly favorable. Your analysis should include:
􀁸 Research questions and project objectives with the support of academic literature
􀁸 Data collection methods, either through API, online scraping, or explaining the data
sources
􀁸 Understanding your data (data types, summary statistics, data visualization, etc.)
􀁸 Data cleaning (missing values, outliers, date/time transformation, data errors, etc.)
􀁸 Feature engineering (categorical variables to dummy variables,
normalization/standardization, feature combination, etc.)
􀁸 Data analysis (time series analysis, machine learning, spatial analysis, advanced
regression analysis, etc.)
􀁸 A summary of your findings and suggestion from your data analysis
Students are required to keep to within an additional 10 percent of the word limit given for
an assignment 􀍴 there are penalties on assignments that are longer than this. Submissions
that go 10-14% over the word limit on an assessment will be subject to a 1 point deduction;
15-19% over a 2 points deduction; 20-24% over a 3 points deduction and 25% or more over
will be awarded a fail (zero) and required to resubmit as a second attempt.
3. Marking
As usual, the purpose of the assignment is to give students the opportunity to demonstrate
their learning in relation to 􀆚he co􀆵r􀆐e􀍛􀆐 in􀆚ended learning o􀆵􀆚come􀆐􀍘 The o􀆵􀆚come􀆐 of 􀆚hi􀆐
course are:
􀁸 Set up, connect to and query a simple relational and non-relational database by
Python
􀁸 Retrieve and analyze data from an Application Protocol Interface (API)
􀁸 Perform basic machine learning tasks
􀁸 Write code according to best practice and produce tidy data
􀁸 Collaborate effectively with other analysts using appropriate tools
􀁸 Produce documentation for their work which makes the processes behind analyses
transparent and reproducible.

Code of Assessment. Please take time to familiarize yourself with the 􀆵ni􀇀er􀆐i􀆚􀇇􀍛􀆐 polic􀇇 on
plagiarism.
4. Getting help
There is time available during the last class lecture sessions for you to ask any related
questions for your final assessment. An essay proposal or outline (maximum 1-page,
formative assessment) is due on the 8th February if you would like to get feedback from your
instructor. This should identify the data science project you want to do for this course, and
outline the objectives, programming tools you want to use, and expected outcomes. You can
also post any questions on the assignment forum on Moodle or email the instructor if you
have specific questions.


There are two Pythin files in the repository:
a. iPython. You could sse the original codes and the output in one file;
b. HTML. This is a knitted HTML file from jupyter notebook.
